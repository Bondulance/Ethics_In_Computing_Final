                        Having accessibility makes sure that everyone regardless of their ability can use it. Digital accessibility ensures everyone can perceive, understand, navigate and interact with information on the internet, regardless of ability. Accessible online content provides an equal experience for those with visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive and neurological disabilities or impairments.But accessibility makes for a better experience for everyone. An accessible and flexible website, for example, will help people with slow internet connections, those with temporary injuries such as a broken arm, or older adults.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Technology increasingly shapes how people interact, work, learn, and communicate. Ensuring accessibility in tech means designing digital products, services, and interfaces so that everyone, including individuals with disabilities, can use them effectively. It should be “accessible” for everyone to impart fairness.

                <ul> 
                    <li><p>Digital Inclusion - tech companies have a duty to ensure that their product supports inclusion</p> </li>
                    <li><p>Right to Participation in the Digital World - tech companies are ethically bound to create platforms that allow every and anyone to be able to socialize, learn and be engaged</p></li>
                    <li><p>Privacy and Security - Tech should protect user’s privacy and ensure that their data is secured.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Legal and moral responsibility - many countries have regulations that mandate accessibility regarding technology ( ADA in the United states ). Adhering to the laws is a legal and moral obligation as we must protect those with disabilities.</p></li>

                    <li><p><strong>Speech Output:</strong>Converts on-screen text into synthesized speech, allowing users to navigate and interact with applications.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Braille Support:</strong>Compatible with various refreshable Braille displays for users who prefer tactile reading.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Wide Application Support:</strong>Works with a range of programs.Customizability: Allows users to adjust voice settings, keyboard shortcuts, and behavior to suit individual preferences.</p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p><strong>No Tactile Feedback:</strong>Touchscreen-only ATMs rely entirely on visual cues and touch input, making them unusable for individuals who are blind or have low vision.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>Lack of Screen Reader Functionality:</strong>Without audio guidance or headphone jacks for privacy, blind users cannot navigate the menus or perform tasks.</p></li>
                    <li><p><strong>No Keyboard Alternative:</strong>Users with motor impairments who rely on physical buttons or alternative input methods are unable to operate such ATMs.</p></li>

                    It is important that information is accessible to everyone, especially those who may have difficulty distinguishing sources of misinformation from helpful information. Even if a person doesn’t usually have issues with this, there are many misleading sites on the Internet. For example, one might expect MartinLutherKing.org to be a trustworthy source of information. After all, it’s a dot org, which most people learn to look for over a dot com. In this case, the ‘org’ is Neo-Nazi forum site stormfront. MartinLutherKing.org was a website seemingly aimed at children, making use of bright colors and simply stated information, that encouraged kids to print out flyers to hand out at school. These flyers called King a “philanderer, a drunk, a liar, a plagiarist, and a cheater.” 
                    While the presence of hate speech on the internet prompts debates about freedom of speech and whether or not it is ethical to filter content, some websites have been made deliberately misleading while being easily accessible.

                    <p>Barriers on the web keep people with disabilities from accessing information and programs that businesses and state and local governments make available to the public online. - ADA</p>
                    <p>A website with inaccessible features can limit the ability of people with disabilities to access a public entity’s programs, services and activities available through that website—for example, online registration for classes at a community college. - ADA</p>
                    <p>Many state and local government services, programs, and activities are offered on the web. These include, for example, things like: Applying for an absentee ballot, Paying tickets or fees, Filing a police report, Attending a virtual town meeting, Filing tax documents, Registering for school or school programs and applying for state benefits programs - ADA</p>
